Dancing With The Devil - Flirting With Catastrophe is a gripping exploration of the great unraveling of our age; the metacrisis. From collapsing institutions to runaway technologies, from the subtle erosion of truth to the accelerating risks woven into every layer of society, this book exposes the hidden hand of Moloch - the destructive force that thrives on competition, fragmentation, and deception.

But this isn’t just a warning. It’s a call to awakening. In clear and piercing language, the book shows how humanity has been seduced into dancing on the edge of catastrophe; and how the only way to step off the ledge is by turning inward, cultivating the light of Consciousness as an antidote to despair, division, and self-destruction.

Part exposé, part roadmap for healing, Dancing With The Devil reveals how ancient patterns of demonic ritual still govern modern systems, and how we can transcend them to create goodness and a world rooted in compassion, unity, and higher awareness.

If you’ve ever sensed that something deeper is driving the crises around us or wondered what it will take to not only survive but transform, then this book offers both the clarity and the courage to face the darkness and move toward the light.
