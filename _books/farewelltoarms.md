A Farewell to Arms: Illustrated Collector’s Edition brings Ernest Hemingway’s timeless tale of love and loss to vivid life through original artwork by Isaac Horton. This beautifully designed volume pairs the complete classic text with immersive illustrations inspired by the landscapes and emotions of the story.

At the book’s end, a curated Hemingway Reflection Journal invites readers to linger on the author’s most enduring words - and write their own thoughts on love, courage, and the human spirit.

Elegant, emotional, and artistically rendered, this edition is designed for readers who want not just to read Hemingway, but to experience him.
