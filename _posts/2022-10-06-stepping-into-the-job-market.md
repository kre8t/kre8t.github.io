The little projects are not enough to pay the bills lately so Im heading down the rabbit hole of finding a new job. We will just have to see what's in store and where it takes me. As if I wasn't busy enough with my creative goals. Currently, Im looking at remote positions and local design opportunities.

It will be a nice chance to go deep with a big company. I miss the bizarre internal dynamics of working on large teams driven hard toward a common goal. This year marks some monumental changes for me and now its time to move back into the tech world. 

What this means for MINIML we will have to see, but I am committed to keeping the code alive and maintained.
